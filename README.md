# About FediForum
FediForum was a gathering of people who move the Fediverse forward.

It consisted of two half days of virtual meetings for discussions, problem solving, and software demos with other Fedi Folk in an unconference format.

It also included speed demos of Fediverse apps and some presentations, as well as ad-hoc working groups, for everyone from developers to users.
